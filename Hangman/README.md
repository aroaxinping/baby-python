# üéÆ HANGMAN GAME

## üìã PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This is a classic Hangman game created in Python. The player must guess a word letter by letter before running out of lives. It's a perfect project to practice basic programming concepts such as:
- Loops
- Conditionals (if/elif/else)
- Lists
- Module imports
- String manipulation

---

## üéØ HOW THE GAME WORKS

### **Rules:**
1. The program chooses a random word from a list
2. The player sees underscores (_) representing each letter
3. The player guesses letters one by one
4. If the letter is in the word ‚Üí it's revealed in its position
5. If the letter is NOT in the word ‚Üí the player loses a life
6. The player has **6 lives** in total
7. **Wins** if they guess the entire word before losing all lives
8. **Loses** if they run out of lives before completing the word

### **Game example:**
```
Word to guess: _____
Guess a letter: a
Word to guess: _a___

Guess a letter: e
You guessed 'e', that's not in the word. You lose a life.
5/6 LIVES LEFT
```

## üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE
```
üìÅ hangman_project/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hangman.py          ‚Üê Main game file (RUN THIS ONE)
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hangman_words.py    ‚Üê List of possible words
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hangman_art.py      ‚Üê Logo and ASCII art drawings of the hangman
```

### **Description of each file:**

#### **1. `hangman.py`** (Main file)
- Contains all the game logic
- Imports words and art from other files
- Handles the main game loop
- Controls lives, wins, and losses

#### **2. `hangman_words.py`**
- Contains the `word_list` with all possible words
- The game chooses a random word from this list
- You can add or remove words as you prefer

#### **3. `hangman_art.py`**
- Contains the game `logo` (title in ASCII art)
- Contains `stages`: a list with 7 hangman drawings
- Each drawing represents a different state (from 6 lives to 0 lives)

---

## üöÄ HOW TO RUN THE GAME

### **Requirements:**
- Python 3.x installed on your computer
- All 3 files must be in the same folder

### **Steps:**

1. **Download or create the 3 files** in the same folder

2. **Open terminal/console** and navigate to that folder:
```bash
   cd path/to/your/folder/hangman_project
```

3. **Run the game:**
```bash
   python hangman.py
```

4. **Play and have fun!** üéâ

## üß† CODE EXPLANATION (STEP BY STEP)

### **PART 1: Imports and initial setup**
```python
import random
from hangman_words import word_list
from hangman_art import logo, stages

print(logo)  # Displays the game title

lives = 6  # Initial lives
game_over = False  # Controls when the game ends
correct_letters = []  # Correctly guessed letters
guessed_letters = []  # All attempted letters (to avoid repetitions)
```

**What does this do?**
- Imports necessary tools (`random` to choose words randomly)
- Imports data from other files (words and art)
- Initializes game variables

**Why two different lists?**
- `correct_letters`: Only stores letters that ARE in the word (used to build the display)
- `guessed_letters`: Stores ALL attempted letters (prevents trying the same letter twice)

---

### **PART 2: Choose word and create initial display**
```python
chosen_word = random.choice(word_list)  # Chooses a random word
placeholder = "_" * len(chosen_word)  # Creates underscores
print("Word to guess: " + placeholder)
```

**What does this do?**
- `random.choice(word_list)` selects a random word from the list
- `"_" * len(chosen_word)` creates a string with as many underscores as letters in the word
  - Example: if `chosen_word = "python"` (6 letters), then `placeholder = "______"`

**The `*` operator with strings:**
- Repeats a string a specified number of times
- `"a" * 3` ‚Üí `"aaa"`
- `"_" * 5` ‚Üí `"_____"`

---

### **PART 3: Main game loop**
```python
while not game_over:
    print(f"****************************{lives}/6 LIVES LEFT****************************")
    guess = input("Guess a letter: ").lower()
```

**What does this do?**
- `while not game_over` means "while the game has NOT ended"
- `not game_over` is the same as `game_over == False`
- The loop continues until `game_over` becomes `True`
- `.lower()` converts everything to lowercase so "A" and "a" are treated the same

---

### **PART 4: Check if letter was already guessed**
```python
if guess in guessed_letters:
    print(f"You've already guessed '{guess}'. Try another letter.")
    continue

guessed_letters.append(guess)
```

**What does this do?**
- Checks if the letter is already in the `guessed_letters` list
- If yes ‚Üí shows a message and `continue` skips the rest of the loop
- If no ‚Üí adds the letter to the list with `.append()`

**Why use `continue`?**
- Without it, the code would continue and the player would lose a life unfairly
- `continue` jumps back to the start of the `while` loop immediately

---

### **PART 5: Build the display (what the player sees)**
```python
display = ""

for letter in chosen_word:
    if letter == guess:
        display += letter
        correct_letters.append(guess)
    elif letter in correct_letters:
        display += letter
    else:
        display += "_"

print("Word to guess: " + display)
```

**What does this do?**
This is the heart of the game! Let's see it with an example:

**Example:** Word is `"python"`, player already guessed `"p"` and `"o"`, now tries `"t"`
```python
correct_letters = ["p", "o"]
guess = "t"
display = ""

# Loop through each letter in "python"
for letter in "python":
    
    # Iteration 1: letter = "p"
    # Is "p" == "t"? NO
    # Is "p" in ["p", "o"]? YES
    # Result: display += "p" ‚Üí display = "p"
    
    # Iteration 2: letter = "y"
    # Is "y" == "t"? NO
    # Is "y" in ["p", "o"]? NO
    # Result: display += "_" ‚Üí display = "p_"
    
    # Iteration 3: letter = "t"
    # Is "t" == "t"? YES
    # Result: display += "t" and correct_letters.append("t")
    # display = "p_t"
    
    # Iteration 4: letter = "h"
    # Is "h" == "t"? NO
    # Is "h" in ["p", "o"]? NO
    # Result: display += "_" ‚Üí display = "p_t_"
    
    # Iteration 5: letter = "o"
    # Is "o" == "t"? NO
    # Is "o" in ["p", "o"]? YES
    # Result: display += "o" ‚Üí display = "p_t_o"
    
    # Iteration 6: letter = "n"
    # Is "n" == "t"? NO
    # Is "n" in ["p", "o"]? NO
    # Result: display += "_" ‚Üí display = "p_t_o_"

# Final result: "p_t_o_"
```

**The three conditions explained:**
1. `if letter == guess`: The current guess matches this letter ‚Üí reveal it
2. `elif letter in correct_letters`: This letter was guessed correctly before ‚Üí show it
3. `else`: This letter hasn't been guessed yet ‚Üí show underscore

---

### **PART 6: Check if letter is incorrect**
```python
if guess not in chosen_word:
    print(f"You guessed '{guess}', that's not in the word. You lose a life.")
    lives -= 1
    
    if lives == 0:
        game_over = True
        print(f"\n***********************IT WAS '{chosen_word}'! YOU LOSE**********************")
```

**What does this do?**
- `if guess not in chosen_word` checks if the letter is NOT in the secret word
- `lives -= 1` is the same as `lives = lives - 1` (subtracts one life)
- If lives reach 0 ‚Üí the game ends and shows the correct word

---

### **PART 7: Check if player won**
```python
if "_" not in display:
    game_over = True
    print("\n****************************YOU WIN****************************")
```

**What does this do?**
- `"_" not in display` checks if there are NO underscores left
- If there are no underscores ‚Üí all letters have been guessed ‚Üí player wins!

---

### **PART 8: Display the hangman drawing**
```python
print(stages[lives])
```

**What does this do?**
- `stages` is a list with 7 drawings (indices 0 to 6)
- `stages[6]` = empty drawing (6 lives remaining)
- `stages[5]` = head only (5 lives remaining)
- `stages[4]` = head + body (4 lives remaining)
- `stages[0]` = complete hangman (0 lives = GAME OVER)

**Why does it work?**
- As `lives` decreases from 6 to 0, we can use it directly as the index
- When `lives = 3`, it shows `stages[3]` (head + body + left arm)

---

## üîÑ COMPLETE GAME FLOW (One Round)

1. **Show remaining lives**: `3/6 LIVES LEFT`
2. **Ask for a letter**: `Guess a letter: t`
3. **Check if already tried**: If yes ‚Üí message and return to step 1
4. **Build display**: Go through the word and show what's been guessed
5. **Check if incorrect**: If not in the word ‚Üí lose a life
6. **Check end conditions**: Won? Lost? ‚Üí End game
7. **Show hangman drawing** (based on remaining lives)
8. **Return to step 1** (if game hasn't ended)

## üé® NICE CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS I WOULD ADD I I KNEW HOW

### **Change difficulty:**
```python
# At the beginning of hangman.py, change:
lives = 10  # Easy mode (more lives)
lives = 6   # Normal mode (classic)
lives = 3   # Hard mode (fewer lives)
```

### **Add words in Spanish:**
In `hangman_words.py`:
```python
word_list = [
    "python",
    "programacion",
    "computadora",
    "elefante",
    "jirafa",
    "mariposa",
    # ... more words
]
```

### **Add hints:**
```python
# In hangman.py, after choosing the word:
if chosen_word == "python":
    print("Hint: It's a programming language üêç")
```

### **Add difficulty levels:**
```python
print("Choose difficulty:")
print("1. Easy (10 lives)")
print("2. Normal (6 lives)")
print("3. Hard (3 lives)")

difficulty = input("Enter 1, 2, or 3: ")

if difficulty == "1":
    lives = 10
elif difficulty == "2":
    lives = 6
else:
    lives = 3
```

## ‚ùì COMMON ERRORS AND SOLUTIONS

### **Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hangman_words'`**
**Solution:** Make sure all 3 files are in the same folder.

### **Error: `NameError: name 'word_list' is not defined`**
**Solution:** Check that `hangman_words.py` contains `word_list = [...]`

### **Error: `IndexError: list index out of range`**
**Solution:** Make sure `stages` in `hangman_art.py` has 7 drawings (indices 0-6)

### **The game doesn't show the drawings**
**Solution:** Uncomment the line `print(stages[lives])` in `hangman.py`

## üéì KEY CONCEPTS LEARNED

### **1. Loops (`for` and `while`)**
- `while` repeats as long as a condition is true
- `for` iterates over each element in a sequence

### **2. Lists**
- Store multiple values: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`
- Add elements: `my_list.append(4)`
- Check if something exists: `if 2 in my_list:`

### **3. Conditionals**
- `if`: executes if condition is true
- `elif`: checks another condition if the first is false
- `else`: executes if all conditions are false

### **4. Imports**
- `import random`: imports an entire module
- `from module import function`: imports a specific function
- Allows code organization in multiple files

### **5. String operators**
- `+` concatenates strings: `"hello" + "world"` ‚Üí `"helloworld"`
- `*` repeats strings: `"a" * 3` ‚Üí `"aaa"`
- `in` checks if a substring exists: `"a" in "apple"` ‚Üí `True`

## üìù NOTES FOR FUTURE REVIEW

If you come back to this code later and don't remember how it works:

1. **Start by reading this README from top to bottom**
2. **Look at the "Code Explanation" section** to understand each part
3. **Check the "Complete Game Flow" section** to understand the game logic
4. **Run the game and add `print()` statements** to see what each variable contains
5. **Experiment!** Change values and see what happens

**Remember:** The best way to learn programming is by doing and making mistakes. Don't be afraid to break the code - you can always fix it! ÔøΩ

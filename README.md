# 🐣 Python First Steps

> My journey starting with Python - from "Hello World" to small functional projects!

## ✨ About This Repo

This is my digital notebook where I document my first steps learning Python. Here you'll find basic exercises, experiments, and mini-projects as I build my programming foundations.

## 📋 Contents

### 🌟 Fundamentals
- **Variables & Data Types** - Playing with strings, numbers, and lists
- **Control Flow** - If/else, loops, and decisions
- **Functions** - Creating my first reusable functions
- **Data Structures** - Lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets

### 🎮 Mini-Projects
- **Simple Calculator** - Basic operations with user input
- **Guessing Game** - Using random and loops
- **To-Do List** - Basic list management
- **Unit Converter** - Temperature, distance, weight

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python
- PyCharm
- Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Lots of coffee ☕ and patience 😅

## 🌱 What I'm Learning

✅ Basic Python syntax  
✅ Logical thinking and problem-solving  
✅ Debugging (aka: finding my own bugs 🐛)  
🔄 Clean code best practices  
🔄 Error and exception handling  


## 🎯 Next Steps

- [ ] Complete data structure exercises
- [ ] Create a more complex integrated project
- [ ] Start with pandas and data analysis
- [ ] Learn about file handling and data management

## 💭 Reflections

*"Every error is a learning opportunity. And I've had many opportunities. "*

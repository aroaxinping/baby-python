# ðŸ’° Tip Calculator

Splits tips between people.

## What I Learned
- Clean user input (remove "%" symbol)
- Convert strings to numbers (`float()`, `int()`)
- Round decimals properly
- Use `.is_integer()` to format output

## Smart Features I added
âœ¨ Handles "15%" or "15" input  
âœ¨ Removes ugly .0 from whole numbers (shows "5" not "5.0")  
âœ¨ Cute welcome message!

## Challenges Fixed
- **Issue:** Crashed with "%" symbol â†’ Fixed by removing it before converting
- **Issue:** Showed 5.0 instead of 5 â†’ Fixed with `.is_integer()` check
